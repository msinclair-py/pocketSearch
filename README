                      ##############

A program that combines the pocket detecting, nearest neighbor
algorithms of fpocket 3.1 with the Voronoi diagram building and
analysis programs, SURF/VASP to qualify good candidates for protein
engineering. The output of this program is a Rosetta pose file for
computational mutagenesis to further screen candidates for wet lab
mutagenesis, and catalysis analysis.

# Installation
To install pocketSearch in it's current form you can just clone this repo.
This can be accomplished by the following command (on a *nix type filesystem):
`gh repo clone msinclair-py/pocketSearch`

# Dependencies
There are a few software dependencies which we have attempted to minimize in
order to run pocketSearch. Firstly, you will need a local install of fpocket 3.0
or above which can be accessed at: https://github.com/Discngine/fpocket. The final
piece of software you will need is SURF/VASP (not to be confused with the popular
ab initio simulation software VASP), which can be found here: 
http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~chen/software.htm. The filepath to both these programs
on you local system must be updated in the `aliases.py` file.

-------------
initialize.py
-------------
This is used to setup the structure containing the desired catalytic pocket.
fpocket must have been run on this already, and the correct pocket identified
before running as this step cannot be automated, nor should it be. After the
pocket has been identified this script will generate conformers of the pocket
in preparation of screening. For a full list of parameters use the -h or --help
flags.

---------------
pocketSearch.py
---------------
This is the screening script. After running initialize.py and obtaining pdbs
to screen against, this will perform the actual screen. PDBs can either be downloaded
in advance or a list of pdbs can be passed via the -m random option (Note: the path to
the list must be present in the aliases.yaml config). For a full list of parameters use the
-h or --help flags.

Bug Reporting
-------------
If you run into any errors while running the code you can submit a post on the github or
directly email me at: msinclair@anl.gov
